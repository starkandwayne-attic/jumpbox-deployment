Site Definitions (bosh-lite)

This directory contains templates that describe the infrastructure-specific
settings and site-wide properties.  The templates are merged in the following order:

  site/disk-pools.yml         If you need to, you can put disk pool
                              definitions in this file.

  site/update.yml             Specify job update parameters here, which can
                              change based on the cloud provider in use,
                              and its performance characteristics.

  site/jobs.yml               Here you can modify the list of jobs defined
                              at the global level, remove jobs (by setting
                              their instances: count to 0), and supply any
                              additional, site-wide job properties.

  site/networks.yml           Define what networks to use for all the
                              environments in this site (although you may
                              want to defer the actual numbering to the
                              environment level.

  site/resource-pools.yml     Set up the resource pools to use for job
                              virtual machines, and apply their cloud
                              properties (i.e. availability zones)

  site/properties.yml         Define properties (both globally and per-job),
                              that are specific to this environment.  These will
                              most likely override global properties.


NOTE: If you make changes to the templates in here, they will automatically
propagate to any newly-created environments, but you will need to run a
refresh for existing environments to receive those updates.
